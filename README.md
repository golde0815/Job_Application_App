# CPSC304 Project

## Demo Info
In our GUI, the Division, Nested Aggregation with GROUP BY and Aggregation with GROUP BY demo items are rendered immediately when the page loads. We essentially run the query immediately on load. As per piazza post https://piazza.com/class/lcfob0rgtel508/post/687, we do believe there shouldn't be any issue with running the query on page load, and hope this is alright!

## SQL script to create and populate tables
Please run the `createAndPopulateTables.sql` file located in the project root.
